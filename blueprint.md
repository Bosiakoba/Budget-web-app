# Budget App Blueprint

## Overview

This is a simple budget tracking application built with Next.js. It allows users to add income and expense transactions and view a summary of their financial activity.

## Features

- Add income and expense transactions.
- View a list of all transactions.
- See the current balance, total income, and total expenses.
- Visualize transactions with a bar chart.

## Design

- The application uses a clean and modern design with Tailwind CSS.
- A color-coded scheme is used to distinguish between income (green) and expenses (red).
- Icons from `lucide-react` are used to enhance the user interface.

## Current Plan

- The current implementation uses in-memory data storage. The next step is to integrate a database for persistent storage.
